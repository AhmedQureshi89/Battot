            "The English idiom \"Break a leg!\" is a well-known expression that means \"Good luck!\" However, it's essential to note that a direct translation might not convey the same meaning in Arabic. In Arabic culture, it's common to use phrases that express good wishes, but \"Break a leg!\" might be perceived as harsh or even violent.\n",
            "\n",
            "To ensure a more accurate and culturally sensitive translation, I chose a phrase that conveys a similar sentiment while being more idiomatic in Arabic. \"كسر ساقك!\" (Kasir saqak!) literally means \"Break your leg!\" but is used to express good luck, similar to the English idiom. This phrase is commonly used in Arabic-speaking countries, especially in theatrical or performance contexts, to wish someone success.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Arabic, the phrase is often used in a more playful or lighthearted tone, which helps to mitigate any potential negative connotations.
